12. connected backend and frontend
13. Create homepage which shows upcoming matches for 2 weeks
14. Added UI for betting modal and connected backend APIs to show betting odds
15. Created User Authentication System

Next to do:

✅ 1. Implement Basic User Creation & Login UI
So far you’re hardcoding users or not creating them at all on the frontend.

Goals:

Create a landing page with a username input to “sign up” or “log in” a user.

Save their userId in localStorage or sessionStorage.

Update the frontend to use this ID when placing a bet.

Why now?

Enables personalized betting

Unlocks the rest of the features (bet history, balance, etc.)

✅ 2. Add Balance + Bet Status UI
Let users see their balance and get feedback after placing a bet.

UI Enhancements:

Display user balance in navbar or top right

After betting, show a toast/snackbar:
✅ “Bet placed! New balance: $4,500”

API Integration:

Use /api/get-user?userId=... to fetch balance

Update balance after placing a bet using /api/place-bet

✅ 3. Create “My Bets” Page
Show users a list of all bets they’ve placed.

New API Endpoint:

js
Copy
Edit
// GET /api/my-bets?userId=abc-123
const { data, error } = await supabase
.from("bets")
.select("\*")
.eq("user_id", userId)
.order("created_at", { ascending: false });
Frontend Goals:

Create /my-bets route

Show list: Match, Date, Team Picked, Odds, Amount, Status (Pending/Won/Lost)
